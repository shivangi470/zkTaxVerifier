# zkTaxVerifier

introduces a privacy-preserving tax compliance verification system (ZKTax) that combines zk-SNARKs and the Poseidon hash function to enable secure and efficient tax verification on the blockchain. By integrating Poseidon into the zk-SNARK circuit, we achieve improved efficiency and reduced complexity in both proof generation and verification. The proposed system can be deployed on Remix IDE, providing a fully decentralized solution for privacy-preserving tax compliance. Future work will focus on further optimizing the system and exploring additional applications of Poseidon in zk-SNARK-based protocols.


Background and Related Work


2.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
ZKPs enable one party (prover) to prove a statement’s validity to another party (verifier) without revealing the statement itself. zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) are a class of ZKPs that provide:

Succinctness: Compact proofs.

Non-Interactivity: Single-step proof and verification.

The Groth16 protocol is widely used for zk-SNARKs due to its constant-size proofs and efficient verification.

2.2 Poseidon Hash Function
The Poseidon hash is a cryptographic hash function optimized for zk-SNARK circuits. Compared to traditional hash functions like SHA-256, Poseidon:

Operates over finite fields, making it efficient for zk-SNARK constraints.
Reduces circuit complexity and proof generation time.
2.3 Related Work
Previous works on privacy-preserving compliance, such as Zcash and Tornado Cash, have leveraged zk-SNARKs for anonymity. However, these systems use computationally expensive hash functions (e.g., Pedersen or SHA256). Our work innovates by integrating Poseidon into a tax compliance protocol, improving both performance and usability.



3. System Design
   
3.1 Problem Statement
Users must prove to tax authorities that their tax computations (e.g., taxable income, deductions, and tax paid) comply with regulations, without exposing private details.

3.2 Protocol Overview

The ZKTax protocol consists of three phases:

Commitment Phase: The user commits to their private tax data using the Poseidon hash.
Proof Generation Phase: The user generates a zk-SNARK proof demonstrating compliance and matching the hash commitment.
Verification Phase: A smart contract verifies the proof and ensures the commitment’s integrity on-chain.


4. Conclusion
ZKTax demonstrates the potential of integrating Poseidon hash into zk-SNARK-based protocols for efficient and privacy-preserving tax compliance. By reducing computational overhead and gas costs, ZKTax is a scalable solution for blockchain-based compliance systems. Future work will explore expanding this framework to other regulatory compliance use cases.

# **ZKTax - Zero Knowledge Proof Tax Compliance Verification** 🧾🔐

## **Introduction** 🚀
ZKTax is a decentralized solution for tax compliance verification using **zk-SNARKs** (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). It ensures that tax data is valid without revealing sensitive information. This project uses the **Groth16** protocol to generate proofs and verify them on the Ethereum blockchain.

## **Tech Stack** ⚙️
- **Rust** 🦀
- **Circom** 🔲
- **snarkjs** 🔑
- **Groth16** ⚖️
- **Ethereum** 🛠️
- **Remix IDE** 💻
- **WebAssembly** 🌐

---

## **Prerequisites** 📋

### **Install Required Tools** 💻

1. **Rust** 🦀:
   Rust is required to build the Circom compiler.

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

2. **Circom** 🔲:
   Circom is the circuit compiler used to define the logic of tax compliance.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
   cd circom
   cargo build --release
   export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release
   ```

3. **snarkjs** 🔑:
   Install **snarkjs** to handle zk-SNARK operations such as proof generation, verification, and key management.

   Install globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g snarkjs
   ```

   Or use **npx** for a local install:

   ```bash
   npm install snarkjs
   ```

---

## **Steps to Build ZKTax** 🔧

### **1. Write the ZKTax Circuit** 📝
Create the circuit that calculates the tax compliance logic. For example, create a file named `taxCompliance.circom` in the `circuits` directory.

Example:

```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template TaxCompliance() {
    signal input income;
    signal input deductions;
    signal output taxPaid;

    taxPaid <== income - deductions;
}

component main = TaxCompliance();
```

---

### **2. Compile the Circuit** ⚡
Compile the circuit using **circom** to generate the necessary files for proof generation.

```bash
circom circuits/taxCompliance.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
```

This generates:
- **taxCompliance.r1cs**: The constraint system.
- **taxCompliance.wasm**: WebAssembly file for the circuit.
- **taxCompliance.sym**: Symbol file for debugging.
